                  EggCubator is an Arduino-based program that controls the
                  incubation period of chicken eggs (or any other type of egg).
                  It's main target is to control the temperature inside the
                  incubator, which uses a PID controller for controlling an
                  heating source. In addition, the controller is also able to
                  rotate a DC motor in order to rotate the eggs every x amount
                  of time. Furthermore, the controller will also be able to
                  control the humidity inside the incubator, by controlling and
                  opening using a servo motor, letting fresh air enter or not.
                  This however, is just theory and I cannot be sure that it will
                  be able to adjust the humidity. Therefore, this must still be
                  tested and implemented.

                  This is a ROS2 package that allows a user to control a DJI
                  Tello drone using ROS topics. Therefore, the user can control
                  the drone using velocity commands or triggering the drone to
                  take-off and land via the respective topics. In addition, the
                  wrapper is also constantly publishing the image feed received
                  by the drone to a topic, as well as the flight data received
                  by the drone. <br />
                  The package is based on the TelloPy library (the latest
                  version), which is a Python library for controlling the Tello
                  drone.

                  This project consisted in creating a Discord Bot for my
                  bachelor Discord server with the purpose of making it easier
                  to manage the server. The bot is able to perform several
                  tasks, such as: <br />
                  &nbsp; - Assigning roles to users <br />
                  &nbsp - Sending a welcome message to new users <br />
                  &nbsp - Provide guidelines for the server and the university
                  <br />
                  &nbsp - etc... <br />
                  Since the initial creation, some of my colleagues have also
                  contributed to the project, adding new features to the bot. As
                  of now, the bot developement will be taken over by an
                  university association from which I am Vice-President, which
                  will favour open-source development.

                  This project will be part of a Youtube series that I will be
                  creating, where I will be explaining on how to create a
                  autonomous robot from scracth using a combination of low-level
                  and high-level programming. <br />
                  This Workspace will contain all the code and files that will
                  be used in the series. <br />
                  The low-level programming will be done using C++ and the
                  Arduino IDE, where I will be creating a library for
                  controlling the robot's motors and sensors. <br />
                  The high-level programming will be done using Python and ROS2,
                  where I will be creating a ROS2 package that will be able to
                  communicate with the arduino board and control the motors and
                  sensors. In addition to this, the design of the robot platorm
                  will also be entirely designed by me, using a CAD software
                  like Fusion 360 or OnShape. As of now, there are still no
                  videos available, but I will be starting to record them soon.

                  This project arised from the need to setup quickly a new
                  Linux/Mac computer with all the necessary tools and programs
                  that I use on a daily basis. Instead of using a bash script, I
                  have decided to implement a Python script that read a Yaml
                  file containing all the tasks that I want to run. <br />
                  Therefore, this way I can easily add new tasks to the file and
                  it would even work for windows, since the script is written in
                  Python. <br />

                <p class="card-text">
                  Since I am a big fan of the Nvim text editor, I have made my
                  own configuration for it. <br />
                  This configuration is using the new Lua API, which is much
                  more powerful than the old Vimscript API and easier to work
                  with.
                  <br />
                  As the plugins manager, I have recently switched from Pakcer
                  to Lazy.nvim, which is able to load nvim plugins on demand,
                  making the startup time much faster. <br />

                  This initial configuration was highly inspired by the Lunarvim
                  where I have changed and added/removed some plugins to suit my
                  needs.
